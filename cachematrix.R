# Inversion of Matrix in R is usually time consuming, 
# and caching the inverse of a matrix can be beneficial 
# rather than computing it again and again.
# The following two functions are used to
# cache the inverse of a matrix.

# Function "makeCacheMatrix()" creates a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix = function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve = function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
